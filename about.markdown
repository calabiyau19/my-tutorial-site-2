### About This Site

This website is part of a tutorial series where I practice setting up Jekyll sites, customizing themes, and deploying to GitHub Pages.

#### What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

How to:

- Set up Xubuntu on a old laptop to act as my local server
- Install Jekyll, Gem and Ruby on that local server
- Modify the default Jekyll theme, making minor changes to _config.yml
- Set up a new site on GitHub, matching my local site in name 
- Set up Jekyll on a remote server at GitHub
- Create and push sites built locally to GitHub Pages
- Customize themes and navigation - minor changes for now
- Manage posts and pages with Markdown
- Edit the About.markdown page from the default to something better

More to come................
